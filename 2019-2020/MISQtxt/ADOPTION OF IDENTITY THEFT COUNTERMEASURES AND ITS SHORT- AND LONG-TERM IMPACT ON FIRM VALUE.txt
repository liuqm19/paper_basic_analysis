RESEARCH NOTE ADOPTION OF IDENTITY THEFT COUNTERMEASURES AND ITS SHORT- AND LONG-TERM IMPACT ON FIRM VALUE1 Indranil Bose Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Diamond Harbor Road, Kolkata 700104  INDIA  {bose@iimcal.ac.in} Alvin Chung Man Leung Department of Information Systems, College of Business, City University of Hong Kong, Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon,  HONG KONG  {acmleung@cityu.edu.hk} Identity theft has impaired e-commerce.  To combat the crime, many identity theft countermeasures (ITC) have been proposed.  As investments in ITC are substantial and the benefits of such investments are intangible, companies are often hesitant to adopt such measures. This was the motivation for this study of the impact of 526 ITC adoption announcements on short- and long-term market value.  The event study shows that such announcements result in positive market return of about U.S. $583 million around the date of announcement.  Calendar-time portfolio analysis (CPA) is used for the long-term impact analysis and shows that the adoption of ITC generates positive and significant average monthly return up to 1.5% with control of market risk factors in two years.  Subsampling analysis and interaction analysis show that U.S. listing, early ITC adoption, and two- factor authentication may moderate the market value of ITC adopters differently.  A number of robustness checks (e.g., Heckman model, cross-sectional regression on Tobin’s Q, firm-specific risk factor analysis, sub- sampling analysis by ICT development, and analysis of security statements in annual reports) are performed.  The research provides quantitative evidence of financial gain resulting from adoption of ITC and aspires to raise ITC awareness among industrial practitioners.

The first publicized incident of identity theft can be traced back to 1943 in the United States (Biegelman 2009).  It is estimated that more than 500,000 cases of identity theft take place in the United States each year.4  Losses due to 3For example, social security number, bank account number, and credit card number. 4News of many identity thefts hit the international media.  For example, Adobe Systems, eBay, LinkedIn. and FriendFinder all experienced hacking and data breaches from 2012 to 2016 with millions of customer credentials stolen,  leading  to  serious  identity  theft  (https://themerkle.com/10-most- effective-data-breaches-in-the-history-of-the-internet/).  Ponemon surveyed 113 global firms and found that on the day data breaches were announced, a firm’s stock value decreased by 5% and customers’ churn rate increased by DOI:  10.25300/MISQ/2019/14192 MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1, pp. 313-327/March 2019 313 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures such cases exceeds U.S. $52.6 billion per year, and 90% of the loss is borne by commercial institutions (Mercuri 2006).  Since loss due to identity theft is tremendous, it is imperative for businesses to adopt ITC.  We define ITC as technical solu- tions to prevent and detect identity theft, and mitigate their negative impact on firms.5  However, many industrial practi- tioners are hesitant about investing in ITC due to high cost.6  To  recover  the  high  setup  costs  of  ITC,  some  companies planned to levy the financial burden on customers.  However, a  recent  survey  by  McKinsey  shows  that  customers  are unwilling  to  pay  extra  costs  for  the  security  they  desire.7 Another reason deterring the use of ITC is the unknown level of acceptance of these measures by customers.8  The decision to adopt ITC is justifiable if there is evidence that such an adoption can increase the market value of firms. To combat identity theft, researchers have analyzed features of online identity theft and developed a number of innovative measures (e.g., email authentication and identification sys- tems  (Wang  et  al.  2009),  and  the  Web  2.0  emergency reporting system (Oh et al. 2013)).  Although many ITCs have been introduced, unless it is evident that the potential gain outweighs  the  high  cost,  there  is  not  much  incentive  for corporations to invest in them (Mercuri 2006). 7% on an average (https://www.cso.com.au/mediareleases/30163/ponemon- australian-research-shows-data-breaches/).  Adobe paid U.S. $1 million to settle the data breach of 38 million accounts (https://krebsonsecurity.com/ 2016/11/adobe-fined-1m-in-multistate-suit-over-2013-breach-no-jail-for- spamhaus-attacker/).  Shortly after a data breach in May 2017, eBay lowered its annual sales target by U.S. $200 million (https://www.scmagazineuk.com/ ebay-counts-the-cost-after-challenging-data-breach/article/541162/). 5Examples of ITC include dynamic password generators, SMS-based one- time passwords, personal digital certification, and electronic signatures (Bose and Leung 2013). 6The cost of a dynamic password generator is between U.S. $20 and $100 per device with a lifespan of two to three years (https://www.wikidsystems.com/ learn-more/authentication-problems/key-fobs-are-an-expensive-hassle/) and the total cost of ownership of various enterprise authentication solutions may vary from U.S. $135,900 to U.S. $316,075.  Enterprise authentication solu- tions include smart device software, hardware one-time passwords (OTPs), smart tokens, mobile OTP soft tokens, PC OTP soft tokens, and SMS OTPs.

(2011) investigated the market impact when firms adopt information security technologies and found that such adoption generates a short-term cumulative abnormal return (CAR) of 1.36%.  However,  the  sample  data  used  in  the  research  were  not specific to ITC but included all types of security measures.11 In addition, most of the previous studies only consider short- term market reaction to IT investment in the United States rather than its long-term impact on a global scale.  This has motivated us to study the impact of ITC adoption using 526 announcements from 312 unique firms in to 39 countries.12  We propose theoretical arguments using the concept of cue utilization theory to explain the positive impact of ITC adop- tion on firm value.  We also identify moderating factors such as country of listing, time of adoption, and government advo- cacy that affect this impact.  Unlike most of the prior studies on IT investment that use the standard capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which suffers from the influence of macro- economic factors (Dewan and Ren 2007), we combine the Fama-French three factor model and the Fama-French inter- national  model  to  better  explain  the  risks  in  the  cross- sectional abnormal return for global firms.  To determine the long-term impact of ITC adoption, we use the CPA to analyze the long-term impact one to two years after such adoption. Our results show that an ITC announcement gives rise to an immediate  positive  cumulative  abnormal  stock  return  of 0.58% on and one day after the announcement, on average, and results in a gain of market capitalization of at least U.S. $583 million per announcement.  The CPA shows that adop- tion of ITC gives rise to an average monthly return ranging from 0.44% to 1.50% in 24 months.  For U.S. listed firms, the short- and long-term market return in the event study and the CPA are significant and positive.  For early adopters of ITC and adopters of two-factor authentication (2FA), mandated by 9According to Forrester Research, companies spent 14% of their IT budget on information security in 2010 (http://www.informationweek.com/security/ management/security-spending-grabs-greater-share-of/229218689). In 2012, despite the economic downturn, the Gartner CIO survey found that 50% of companies maintained the same IT security budget and 45% anticipated that the budget would increase (http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/ Security- Infrastructure-Market-to-Top-86-Billion-in-2016-Gartner-591583/). 10Appendix A lists these studies and their source of data, tests used, and generated returns. 11For example, intrusion detection systems, anti-virus, anti-worms, and fire walls. 12Some examples of announcements related to adoption of ITC are shown in Appendix B. many governments, the market return is significant and posi- tive in the event study but marginal in the CPA. The inter- action analysis shows that the two-way interaction of early ITC adoption and U.S. country factor generates positive and significant market return in both the event study and the CPA. However,  the  interaction  effect  of  2FA  and  U.S.  country factor is only significant and positive in the event study.  The significant U.S. country factor coincides with the fact that there are more U.S. firms with security related statements in their annual reports than firms listed elsewhere.  Our study also  passes  a  number  of  robustness  tests  (e.g.,  Heckman model,  Tobin’s  Q  model,  and  long-term  firm-specific  risk model).  This study complements the study by Gordon et al. (2010) on voluntary disclosure of information security risks.  It shows that apart from corporate disclosure, proactive action taken by companies against identity theft is also rewarded by the equity markets. Theoretical Background ITC as a Cue to Online Safety According to cue utilization theory (Cox 1967), products or services provided by a company may send signaling cues to individuals  that  “enable  them  to  make  indirect  judgments using information which is available” (Sullivan and Burger 1987,  p.  64).    Adoption  of  ITC  is  a  strong  cue  that  the adopters are willing to deter identity theft.  There are several reasons for that.  First, ITC can reduce the risks in online transactions.  Adoption of ITC may send a positive cue to investors about safeguarding online safety.  Previous research shows that security related cues can alleviate their information security  concerns  about  online  transactions  (Pavlou  et  al. 2007).    Second,  disclosure  of  security  related  information (e.g.,  announcement  of  ITC  adoption)  may  send  cues  to investors about their commitment to address security related risks (Gordon et al. 2010) and reduce potential litigation costs from customers due to inadequate security measures to protect their  personal  information.    Previous  research  on  patent infringement  shows  that  litigation  may  hurt  defendants’ market value (Raghu et al. 2008).  Third, adoption of ITC can deter potential adversaries who may prefer firms with weaker security measures to enhance their rate of successful attacks.  Previous research shows that security and privacy assurance13 may reduce transactional uncertainty and increase purchase conversion (Ozpolat et al. 2013).  Finally, investment in ITC can  provide  more  information  to  investors  for  evaluating firms’ safety and help reduce information asymmetry.  The Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures reduced information asymmetry can generate higher market return and avoid lemon market problems (Gordon et al. 2010). Adoption of ITC:  Short- and Long-Term Impacts Technology  elicits  both  symbols  and  symptoms  of  trust- worthiness (Riegelsberger et al. 2005).  ITCs are protective measures against identity theft.  The decision to adopt an ITC is a symbol of better online security and a safer transactional environment.  The short-term market reaction may capture the initial response due to general market perception to symbols of ITC.  Symptoms are by-products of trustworthy actions, which are reflected in customer reviews and external evalua- tions (Riegelsberger et al. 2005).  As the quality of credence of information security is difficult to determine before use (Ray et al. 2011), people may rely on external reviews or self- experience  to  determine  the  effectiveness  of  an  ITC  after using it for some time.  When customers and investors have used and experienced an ITC for a long time, their response to the ITC may change.  This is also in line with the idea of two-stage process of cue utilization where customers collect specific information about cues in the first stage of cue acqui- sition and form judgments about attributes of interest in the second stage of attribute evaluation (Olson and Jacoby 1972). When customers have used the ITCs offered by a firm for some time they form an opinion about these security features and the providing firms.  Such an opinion is reflected in long- term market reaction. Hypotheses Development Prior studies14 generally agree that investments in IT can give rise to positive excess market return.  Similar to IT invest- ment, ITCs can mitigate security threats on organizational resources.    When  firms  adopt  ITCs,  they  encourage  more customers to use their online services and alleviate investors’ concerns  about  identity  theft.    Adoption  of  ITC  may  be viewed as cues by market participants that the adopters have realized the danger of threats associated with online transac- tions.  Also, recognition of security threats and adoption of ITC allow firms to focus on core business activities (Gupta et al. 2000).  Tightened security control in the areas of fraud detection  and  transaction  verification  can  yield  monetary benefits that are at least 25% higher than the cost of adoption of such security measures.15  Apart from customers, investors 14See Appendix A for details of prior studies. 13For example, TRUSTe’s certificate of compliance of privacy policy and VeriSign’s digital certificate of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connections. 15https://www.gartner.com/doc/496217/transaction-verification- complements-fraud-detection. MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No.1/March 2019 315 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures (particularly institutional investors) also care about data and cybersecurity because security measures directly affect firms’ performance.    The  Council  of  Institutional  Investors    (CII 2016) published a report, “Prioritizing Cybersecurity,” to raise the awareness of members to firms’ cybersecurity practices in investment.16  Many asset management companies (e.g., JP Morgan  and  Schroders17)  have  released  reports  to  express their concern about data and cyber insecurity in investment.  KPMG  also  reported  that  the  majority  of  institutional investors (79%) are not keen to invest in businesses that have been hacked.18   Therefore, we posit: H1:  Adoption of ITC increases short-term market return19 of adopting firms. Perception about ITC is a credence quality that may not be determined before actual usage or with little exposure (Ray et al. 2011).  Through frequent interaction with ITC, customers and  investors  understand  the  technology  better.    Positive interaction experience may foster long lasting customer rela- tionships (Riegelsberger et al. 2005) and positive long-term market return.  Moreover, as customers use ITC more often, the cues acquired about ITC in the first stage of cue acquisi- tion are evaluated in terms of their impact.  As customers experience a safer online environment for conducting business and become free of worries related to identity theft, this helps them  form  a  positive  judgment  about  the  impact  of  ITCs.  Adopting ITC to deter identity theft may also be a cue of management’s professionalism and far-sightedness.  Invest- ment in security is an enabler for business that reduces opera- tional risks.  The initiative to adopt security measures is a reflection of management’s commitment to manage IT risks and treat information security as a strategic asset for the firm (von Solms 2006).  Therefore, a long-term market return is a response to sound managerial practices.  We hypothesize: H2:  Adoption of ITC generates a higher long-term market return20 for the adopting firms. 16https://www.bitsighttech.com/blog/do-investors-care-about-cybersecurity. 17ttps://www.jpmorgan.com/jpmpdf/1320633569852.pdf  and  http://www. schroders.com/staticfiles/Schroders/Sites/global/pdf/Why-investors-should- care-about-data-security-risk.pdf. 18https://home.kpmg.com/uk/en/home/insights/2015/04/institutional- investors-shy-away-from-hacked-businesses.html. 19We define short-term market return as market return three days around the announcement of ITC adoption (i.e., one day before, on, and one day after the date of announcement). Several factors may moderate the effect of ITC adoption.21  Personal  predisposition  and  security  cues  may  moderate individuals’  perceived  security  control  (Ray  et  al.  2011).  Personal predisposition is related to familiarity with ITC and concern  about  identity  theft.    U.S.  investors  may  be  more familiar with ITC and have higher awareness of identity theft. There  are  various  reasons.    First,  the  diffusion  rate  of e-commerce in the United States is much higher than the rest of the world (Gibbs and Kraemer 2004).  Second, a number of major identity theft incidents have taken place in the United States.  To check the exponential growth of identity theft, the U.S. Federal Government mandated all institutions to imple- ment  the  “Red  Flag”  program  to  address  the  problem  of identity theft in favor of customers by 2008.22  With frequent exposure to e-commerce, investors in the United States are more  aware  of  online  threats.    As  per  the  cue  utilization theory proposed by Cox (1967), an important determinant of cue usage is the confidence value of the cue or the ability of the consumer to correctly evaluate a cue.  Since U.S. cus- tomers and investors are more aware of security breaches and ITCs, they exhibit a higher confidence value of the cue and react more positively to the cue generated by ITC adoption. H3a:    Firms  listed  in  the  United  States  exhibit higher short-term market return when they adopt ITC compared to firms listed in other countries. Futijtsu found that American companies consistently contrib- uted over 45% to the global enterprise information security market in 2013–2017 with a steady growth of 8.3% per year.23 The increase in spending is not just in security technologies but in an ecosystem that allows people to benefit from the technologies.  Therefore, investors in the United States should have more exposure to e-commerce and display heightened security awareness.  Previous research shows that economic and regulatory measures, as well as cultural differences, may influence  cross-country  technology  diffusion  (Zhu  and Kraemer 2005) and selection of electronic communication media (Straub 1994).  Frequent usage of e-commerce services and ITC in the U.S. markets may allow investors to evaluate 21Melville et al.’s (2004) IT business value model suggests that apart from focal firm factors, macro and competitive environments may moderate the business value of a firm upon adoption of IT.  Macro environmental factors include  country  characteristics  and  government  promotion.    Competitive environmental factors include competitive advantage of a technology over time.  Therefore, in H3–H5, we hypothesize that country, time, and govern- ment advocacy may moderate firm value that results from ITC adoption. 22https://www.forrester.com/report/Red+Flag+Compliance+Are+You+Rea dy/-/E-RES47212. 20We define long-term market return as market return that occurred one to two years after the announcement of ITC adoption. 23http://ts.fujitsu.com/rl/ff2014/downloads/BOS-C117b-Security-as-an- Important-Contributor-to-Business-Success.pdf. 316 MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1/March 2019 the  effectiveness  of  ITC  more  accurately.    Therefore,  the United States as a country may affect investors’ realization of long-term benefits of ITC more saliently than other countries. H3b:    Firms  listed  in  the  United  States  exhibit higher long-term market return when they adopt ITC compared to firms listed in other countries. responsive  Time  of  adoption  plays  an  important  role  in  moderating individuals’ perceived security control.  Early adoption of ITC may  send  a  strong  cue  to  investors  that  the  adopters  are conscious about deterring identity theft.  It also generates an impression  of  being  the  competitive e-commerce environment (Lee and Grewal 2004).  Being the first to adopt ITC, adopters can enjoy unique market advan- tages  and  stay  ahead  of  their  competitors  (Lieberman  and Montgomery 1988).  The year 2008 marked the boundary between early and late ITC adoption because most of the laws against identity theft were passed in that year.24  Therefore, we hypothesize: to  H4a:  Early ITC adopters (pre-2009)25 show higher short-term market return than late adopters. Early adopters of new technology usually enjoy sustainable lead time advantages that include technological leadership and imposition of high switching costs on customers (Lieber- man  and  Montgomery  1988).    Technology  leadership  can create a differential advantage for the first mover (Kerin et al. 1992).  Market pioneers who adopt ITC early can quickly attract a large number of security conscious customers.  Over time,  customers  may  become  more  attached  the e-commerce services provided by adopters.  Although other competitors may adopt similar ITC over time, as customers are more familiar with the systems provided by the market pioneers,  they  may  find  it  inconvenient  to  switch  to  other companies (Wade and Hulland 2004).  As a result, firms may enjoy long-term advantages.  Therefore, we posit: to  24The U.S. Federal Government mandated that all banks should implement “Red Flag Rules” by November 2008 to take a more proactive approach to detect possible identity theft (Bose and Leung 2014).  A number of states, such as Arkansas, California, and Texas, passed stringent laws against iden- tity theft before 2008 (Bose and Leung 2014).  The Monetary Authority of Singapore mandated the adoption of 2FA by the end of 2007 (Bose and Leung 2013); the Korea Financial Services Commissions required a similar mandate to be implemented by January 2008 (http://www.an16.afponline.org/ docs/default-source/default-document-library/pdf/cp_afp-south_korea- pdf.pdf?sfvrsn=0). 25We also tried other time periods to define early adoption, for example, pre- 2005.  The results were found to be qualitatively similar. Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures H4b:  Early ITC adopters (pre-2009) show higher long-term market return than late adopters. In the face of identity theft, e-commerce firms adopt different types of ITC.  Some advanced ITC such as 2FA26 are advo- cated  by  governments  and  regulatory  organizations  in  the United  States,  the  European  Union,  India,  Hong  Kong, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea.27  The strong govern- ment advocacy of 2FA may send a cue to investors that the adopter has implemented stronger ITC than their peers.  This may generate a positive impression about the adopter among investors, which in turn may lead to higher trust (Miyazaki et al. 2005).  Therefore, we posit: H5a:  Adoption of government-advocated sophisti- cated  ITC  generates  a  higher  short-term  market return for the adopting firm than adoption of any other ITC. 2FA with strong government advocacy may help the adopter achieve long-term competitive advantage for several reasons. First, adversaries find them difficult to crack.  Adoption of such tools can help provide customers with a safe e-commerce environment  and  thereby  increase  patronage.    The  higher number of transactions can generate immediate cash flow, giving rise to a positive market reaction (Burton et al. 1999). Furthermore, the endorsement of the technology by govern- ments may generate trust among customers and encourage more frequent use of related tools (King et al. 1994).  More customer  feedback  on  the  use  of  ITC  allows  investors  to realize the advantages of the technology and help them attain a long-term competitive advantage (Keen 1991). 262FA requires users to possess two factors, “what you know” (e.g., pass- word) and “what you own” (e.g., dynamic password generator, SMS-based one-time password, personal digital certificate) for the sake of authentication. Even if the password of a user is compromised, the adversaries cannot steal the  user  account  without  the  additional  security  device  (i.e.,  “what  you own”).  Therefore, 2FA is stronger than conventional password-based authen- tication system. 27The U.S. Federal Government recommended the use of 2FA whenever available (https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/techftc/2012/05/problem- passwords).  The European Banking Authority required all member com- panies to deploy 2FA by August 2015 (http://www.secureidnews.com/news- item/eu-payment-service-providers-face-deadline-for-two-factor- implementation/).  The Reserve Bank of India made 2FA compulsory for all online payments in India by August 1, 2009 (http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/ features/two-factor-authentication-is-a-bother-can-it-get-better-641813). The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (http://www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/press/ 2004/20041007e4.htm)  and  the  Monetary  Authority  of  Singapore (http://www.mas.gov.sg/about_us/annual_reports/annual20052006/Index_ B/B50_box10.htm) mandated the adoption of 2FA by 2005 and 2007, respec- tively.  The Basic Act on Electronic Financial Transactions (2006) mandated that all banks in the Republic of Korea with Internet banking service should use  2FA  by  January  2007  (http://www.an16.afponline.org/docs/default- source/ default-document-library/pdf/cp_afp-south_korea-pdf.pdf?sfvrsn=0). MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No.1/March 2019 317 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures H5b:  Adoption of government-advocated sophisti- cated ITC gives rise to a higher long-term market return for the adopting firms than adoption of any other ITC. In the above set of hypotheses, we posit that individual factors have  a  disparate  impact  on  both  the  short-  and  long-term market value of ITC adopters.  However, previous research has shown that a standalone factor analysis may not be able to capture the interrelationship among the key factors, and to remediate this deficiency researchers should consider multi- plicative  interaction  effects  (Blalock  1965).    Interaction effects have been widely studied in prior IS research.  For example, Zhu and Kraemer (2002) found that the interaction effect  of  e-commerce  capability  and  IT  intensity  is  more significant than the effect of the standalone factors.  Dewan and  Ren  (2007)  found  that  the  interaction  effect  among service firms is strongest when IT investment intensity is high and  the  investment  took  place  recently.    Therefore,  we exhaustively test all two-way interactions of the three main factors and propose: H6a(b):  Firms listed in the United States that adopt ITC early (pre-2009) have higher short- (long-) term market return than other companies. H6c(d):  Government-advocated sophisticated ITC adopters  listed  in  the  United  States  have  higher short- (long-) term market return than other firms. H6e(f):    Early  (pre-2009)  government-advocated sophisticated  ITC  adopters  have  higher  short- (long-) term market return than other firms. Research Method and Findings We analyzed the short- and long-term impact of ITC adoption announcements.    For  the  short-term  analysis,  we  used  the event study method.  A limitation of the event study was the inability to account for cross-sectional dependency of events (Kothari and Warner 2007).  To remediate this limitation, we used  the  CPA  to  determine  the  long-term  impact  of  ITC adoption. Analysis of Short-Term Impact  The event study was conducted for short-term market analy- sis.28  Initially, 17,569 announcements were retrieved from 28The steps of the event study are shown in Appendix C. 318 MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1/March 2019 Factiva.  Next, announcements that might be affected by con- founding news were eliminated,29 leaving 526 announcements from 1995 to 2016 as shown in Table 1.30 The  market  model  based  on  the  CAPM  as  represented  by equation (1)31 was selected. R it = + Rα β i i mt + ε it (1)  The  CAPM  has  been  criticized  in  prior  research  for  its inability to capture all market risks that led to miscalculation of market return (Fama and French 1992).  To overcome the inadequacy of the CAPM, we used the Fama-French three- factor model as shown in equation (2).32 ) − = + R γ i SMB t R it ft ( α β R i i mt + HML t + δ i − R ε + it ft (2) To make this model usable in an international context, Fama and  French  (1998)  added  an  international  book-to-market correction factor (IHML) in the CAPM.

Next, the CAR of stock prices was computed along  with  the  parametric  Z  test,  the  sign  Z  test,  and  the Corrado’s rank test.34  We evaluated the short-term impact in terms of the CAR one day before, on, and one day after the announcement.  To account for potential self-selection bias, we  also  implemented  the  Heckman  model.35    Finally,  the overall  financial  impact  was  computed  by  multiplying  the cumulative abnormal return with the product of the average stock  price  and  the  average  number  of  outstanding  shares (McWilliams and Siegel 1997).  Analysis of Long-Term Impact To estimate the long-term market reaction due to adoption of 34The steps for the computation of the CAR of stock prices are shown in Appendix  E.  The  details  related  to  the  nonparametric  tests  used  in  this research are provided in Appendix F.  ITC, we used the CPA.36  In this method, we first constructed a portfolio made up of firms making the announcements, and measured the long-term return of that portfolio against a mar- ket index.  The main advantage of the CPA was that it did not depend on the cross-sectional variance (Lyon et al. 1999), and the monthly returns were serially uncorrelated (Kothari and Warner 2007).  Therefore, the statistical inference could be more accurate than the event study.  To account for the non- U.S. data, we extended the original CPA for international data analysis.  We also conducted the CPA for 18 and 24 months as  part  of  sensitivity  analysis,  followed  by  a  subsampling analysis. Research Findings Table 2 shows that positive mean CARs were obtained in all event windows.  The insignificant CARs in the event window [-1] might imply that there was not much news leakage and the investors did not react strongly prior to the announce- 35See Appendix G for details. 36The details of the CPA are shown in Appendix H. MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No.1/March 2019 319 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures ments.  For both the CAPM and the FFM, the ARs and CARs in the event windows of [0], [1], [0,1], and [-1, 1] were posi- tive and significant for both parametric and nonparametric tests.  Hence, H1 is strongly supported.  Table 3 shows the long-term ARs of the CPA as a result of ITC adoption over 12, 18, and 24 months.  Positive ARs were attained over all time periods for the CAPM.  The magnitude of the ARs in- creased over time.  Although ARs were insignificant in the FFM over 12 months and 18 months, they were positive and significant  in  the  CAPM  and  the  FFM  over  24  months. Therefore, H2 is partially supported.   Subsampling Analysis Panel A of Table 4 indicates that the CARs of the US sub- sample  are  positive  and  statistically  significant  for  all statistical tests, giving strong support to H3a.  In Panel B of Table  4,  our  results  demonstrated  a  first  mover  advantage when  using  the  CAPM.    For  announcements  made  before 2009, the CARs were statistically significant and larger in magnitude in comparison to those for announcements made in and after 2009.  However, in the FFM, the mean CAR of the pre-2009 subsample was slightly less than that of the Recent subsample.  Therefore, H4a is partially supported.  Panel C of Table 4 shows that the adoption of the government-advocated 2FA exhibited higher and significant CARs in the CAPM and the  FFM  than  the  adoption  of  non-2FA  ITC.    So  H5a  is supported.    A  similar  result  was  observed  in  the  cross- sectional regression.37 Panel A of Table 5 shows that U.S. firms exhibited signi- ficantly positive ARs in both the CAPM and the FFM, giving support  to  H3b.    Panel  B  shows  that  the  ARs  for  early adopters were not significant in most cases and always smal- ler  in  magnitude  than  that  of  late  adopters.    Thus,  H4b  is rejected.  Panel C shows that the 2FA subsample exhibited positive and significant ARs in 24 months in both the CAPM and the FFM, but inconsistent results were obtained for the time period of 12 and 18 months.  So, H5b is partially sup- ported.  The results were mostly consistent with the findings of the short-term analysis.  We used Tobin’s Q as an alterna- tive measure of long-term return in a cross-sectional regres- sion38 and found that the U.S. factor was positive and signi- ficant.  Furthermore, we found that after adopting ITC, firms experienced reduction in firm-specific risks in a time period of 24 months.39 37See Appendix I for details. 38See Appendix J for details. 39See Appendix K for details. 320 MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1/March 2019 Interaction Analysis Panel A of Table 6 confirms the significant effects of US×Old on short-term market value in all tests and provides support to H6a.  In Panel B, 2FA×US shows positive and significant CARs in the CAPM and the FFM, providing support to H6c.  2FA×Old was positive and significant in all tests, as shown in Panel C.  However, the mean CAR of the interaction factor was higher than that of the counter subsample in the CAPM but not in the FFM.  Therefore, H6e is partially supported. The  impact  of  US×Old  on  long-term  market  value  was significant and positive in all windows in Panel A of Table 7. H6b is supported.  2FA×US gave rise to higher ARs than the non-2FA×US subsample in all three time periods in Panel B.  They were positive and significant for 12 months but insigni- ficant for 18 and 24 months.  H6d is partially supported.  The ARs for 2FA×Old were not significant in most cases in Panel C.  Therefore, H6f is not supported.  The overall results for all hypotheses are shown in Table 8. Discussion We  demonstrated  that  the  adoption  of  ITC  positively impacted both short- and long-term firm value.  Adoption of ITC gave rise to an increase in market capitalization of at least U.S. $583 million40 in the event window [0, 1].  While the short-term market return in the event window of [0, 1] was 0.58% (mean CAR of the CAPM and the FFM), the range of long-term market return was much wider from 0.44% (AR using the FFM) to 1.50% (AR using the CAPM) at 24 months after the event.  The higher long-term market return might be due to the familiarity with ITC and better evaluation of the cues related to adoption of ITC as well as development of long-term trust by adopters of ITC.  When investors realized the benefits of ITC, they developed higher trust on the service providers and were more likely to continue their investment.  This translated to higher long-term market value as reflected in the CPA. The results related to short-term impact of ITC adoption were similar to the studies on IT investment by Dos Santos et al. (1993) and Im et al. (2001).  Both types of IT investment were found to be positive in the event study.  However, different from the findings of Im et al. (2001), earlier adopters had more positive and significant CARs than late adopters.  In terms of magnitude of short-term impact, the adoption of ITC resulted in smaller CAR than that due to IT investment, as 40See Appendix L for details of calculation of financial impact as a result of ITC adoption.

Although ITC were essential to ensure  the  safety  of  electronic  transactions  from  security breaches, the adoption of such a technology alone could not directly generate revenues like IT investments.  Understand- ably,  the  investors  showed  a  subdued  reaction  to  such announcements. We were unable to compare the long-term return with extant literature  due  to  the  paucity  of  research  on  IT  investment using the CPA.  However, the positive return in the study might suggest that ITC investment had complimentary effects on business performance.  Furthermore, the CPA showed that ITC adopters took at least 24 months to realize the significant and positive abnormal return generated by ITC.  The long realization  time  might  be  due  to  varying  degrees  of information  security  awareness  in  different  countries.  Generation  of  information  security  awareness  was  a  time- consuming activity.  In our analysis of annual reports of all sample firms,42 we found that there were many U.S. listed firms with security related statements but not so many such firms in other countries.  Identity theft awareness might be an important  factor  to  determine  the  long-term  effect  of  ITC adoption.  Furthermore, ITC adoption might be a cue of man- agement’s professionalism and far-sightedness.  The positive long-term  effect  might  be  a  reaction  to  sound  managerial practices. Our subsampling analysis revealed some interesting results.  U.S.  country  factor  had  a  significant  short-  and  long-term impact.  The United States was ahead of other countries in terms of penetration of e-commerce and the familiarity of its citizens about ITC.  The lack of technological infrastructure, financial resources, and technological readiness impeded the diffusion  of  electronic  services  in  developing  countries (Javalgi et al. 2004).  This in turn could lead to their lack of awareness about adoption of ITC.  Customers and investors in the United States showed a higher confidence value for evaluation  of  cues  due  to  their  familiarity  with  security technologies  and  security  breaches  and  exhibited  a  more positive  and  significant  reaction  to  adoption  of  ITC.    An implication of our research was that the market recognized the importance of ITC only when it reached a certain level of technological maturity.43 41Investment in innovative IT generated a CAR of 1.03% (Dos Santos et al.  1993) whereas our research shows that adoption of ITC generated mean CARs of 0.58% (using the CAPM and the FFM) in the event window of [0, 1]. 42See Appendix N for details. 43Our additional analysis (see Appendix M) showed that firms in countries with higher information and communications development exhibited more positive and significant short- and long-term impact. 324 MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1/March 2019 Announcements made in earlier time periods gave rise to a strong impact in the short-term but only moderate impact in the long-term.  When ITC was first introduced, early adopters had  first  mover  advantages  because  investors  had  high expectations about the tools.  Such an adoption sent a strong cue to investors that the early adopters were innovative and customer-centric.  Thus, they were rewarded highly by the market.  However, when people became more familiar with the tools over time, the surprise related to adoption of the tools  declined.    Therefore,  in  terms  of  short-term  market reaction,  earlier  adopters  experienced  more  positive  and significant market return.  However, the long-term market return was not significant in most statistical tests. With the passage of time, more firms adopted ITC due to mandatory government policies and enactment of identity theft laws.  As a result, the competitive edge of ITC adoption deteriorated over time due to ubiquitous adoption.  Early adopters of ITC, therefore, did not sustain their advantage in the long run. 2FA was one of the high quality ITCs strongly recommended by regulatory bodies around the globe.  Some countries (e.g., European Union, India, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore) even mandated the adoption of 2FA for high- risk online transactions.  In the short-term event study, the results  also  showed  that  the  CARs  immediately  after  the announcement of 2FA adoption were positive and significant.  Government  advocacy  may  influence  the  cue  of  ITC  to investors.  Compliance with government policies may lead to fewer  lawsuits  and  penalties  for  firms.    The  adoption  of government advocated ITC may imply lower expenses for firms in the future due to reduced identity theft related law- suits and penalties.  Therefore, the market rewarded such an adoption positively and immediately.  Such a positive effect was  more  salient  when  2FA  was  adopted  by  U.S.  firms, before 2009, and first introduced to the market.  This might be associated  with  the  heightened  concern  about  information security in the United States.  However, when people became more familiar with the technologies, the surprise of investors declined over time.  Furthermore, with more usage, people became  more  aware  of  the  weaknesses  of  2FA  over  time. Thus, we found that abnormal reaction of early adopters of 2FA were not significant in the CPA. We contributed to the cue utilization theory by identifying various antecedent factors that may influence the confidence value of a cue in the context of information security.  Alt- hough ITC adoption sent a cue of online safety to investors, the market reaction varied.  We showed that lead-time advan- tage  and  familiarity  with  ITC  played  significant  roles  in influencing investors’ confidence value of the cue.  The cue of ITC adoption was the strongest when such an adoption was early and occurred in the United States where investors had adequate  prior  knowledge  and  exhibited  familiarity  with related technology or associated risks.  The strong cue led to positive  and  significant  short-term  and  long-term  market returns. Extant research on information security focused on the value of  internal  compliance  for  internal  stakeholders  such  as employees (D’Arcy et al. 2009).  Our study might comple- ment the literature in this area by providing new insights from the perspective of an external stakeholder.  Our study showed that  prior  experience  about  identity  theft  and  ITC  was important in ascertaining both short- and long-term market value of ITC adoption.44 Our  study  made  new  methodological  contributions  to  IS research  on  IT  business  value.    Traditional  IS  researchers primarily focused on the immediate market response to IT investment and lacked attention to long-term business value.  Traditional methods such as the event study only revealed the short-term market value of certain IT investment over a few days.  However, IT investment such as investment in ITC required  a  longer  time  for  customers  and  investors  to familiarize themselves with the technology.  As a result, the short-term analysis might not fully reflect the actual benefits of the investment.  Our use of the CPA might remediate the shortcomings of the event study method and introduce a new way to analyze the long-term business value of IT investment. Furthermore, this research highlighted that some hypothesized variables alone might not be able to explain the positive return associated with ITC adoption.  It was only when one variable was  combined  with  another  variable  that  the  impact  was found  to  be  positively  significant.    For  instance,  Old  was insignificant as a standalone factor in the CPA.  However, US×Old was significant in the CPA.  Interaction effects have not been frequently tested in prior event studies (Oh et al. 2006).  Our research emphasized the need to study interaction effects. 44In our main analysis, the U.S. listed firms enjoyed higher market returns in both the short- and long-term than their international peers.  Such higher market returns might be related to more security experience of investors.  As shown in Table N1 in Appendix N, about 84.9% of U.S.-listed firms provided security  related  information  in  their  annual  reports  one  year  before  ITC adoption whereas only 60.7% of non-U.S. firms did so.  U.S. investors might have gained some knowledge about ITC or the security threat of identity theft before the announcement of ITC adoption.  Therefore, they appreciated ITC adoption more than their counterparts in other countries. Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures Limitations and Future Research Directions Since we analyzed the impact on firm value using the event study and the CPA, only listed companies were investigated.  Non-listed companies were not analyzed.  Also, due to the limited availability of IHML data, only companies listed in 20 non-U.S. countries could be analyzed.  In future, we plan to adopt multidimensional analyses and use data items such as sales,  number  of  customers,  and  customer  satisfaction  to measure firm performance after ITC adoption.  In this study, we analyzed the behavior of investors on receiving the news about  investments  in  ITC.    The  rationale  leading  to  such behavior was unknown.  Detailed semi-structured interviews might be conducted in future to discover the rationale used by managers for adopting ITC.  As shown in this study, U.S. and non-U.S. investors demonstrated remarkable differences in their  reaction  to  the  announcements.    This  implied  that  it might be worthwhile to study if culture had a role to play.  Finally, the findings of this research were restricted to ITC. We could extend the study to other security measures, such as anti-brand spoofing and network intrusion detection in future. Conclusion In this research, we analyzed the short- and long-term impact of adoption of ITC on the market value of the firm.  Adopting the event study, we analyzed the short-term impact (one day before, on, and one day after the date of announcement) using the CAPM and the FFM.  Using the CPA, we investigated the long-term change in stock prices 12, 18, and 24 months after the announcement took place.  We observed that firms listed in the United States yielded significant and positive return in the short- and long-term when they adopted ITC, whereas firms that were early adopters of ITC showed a significantly positive reaction in the short-term.  The interaction analysis showed that government-advocated ITC played an important moderating role when it was adopted by U.S.-listed firms.  Our research provided strong encouragement to firms to adopt ITC, as it led to a change in average market capitalization of at least U.S. $583 million per announcement. With regard to academic contributions, our study introduced the CPA to analyze the long-term impact of IT investments. This is complementary to the event study, which measured the instant  market  reaction.    Long-term  analysis  might  give investors  more  time  to  assess  the  post-investment  perfor- mance of adopters.  We encourage future researchers to make use of the CPA in analyzing return on investment for other types of IT.  Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the interaction effects of moderating factors should be considered so as to capture the latent multiplicative effects. MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No.1/March 2019 325 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures From a practical point of view, our research highlighted the importance of being an early mover in the adoption of ITC.  The market generated immediate rewards for early movers.  Similar to early movers, U.S.-listed companies also yielded positive and significant short-term market return when they adopted ITC.  As U.S. customers and investors were more aware of the benefits of ITC, the positive return lasted for a longer time period.  Furthermore, our research stressed the need to adopt sophisticated ITC.  Newer and more secure technologies could safeguard customers against identity theft.  In the short term, the market strongly rewarded U.S. firms that were adopters of sophisticated ITC.  However, over time, the weakness of existing ITC might become more well known.  So, relying on one type of ITC might not generate sustainable long-term  market  value.    It  is  advised  that  firms  should regularly  update  their  ITC  to  keep  abreast  of  the  latest technologies. Acknowledgments We are indebted to the senior editor, H. R.

For example, Dos Santos et al. (1993) studied IT innovativeness and Chatterjee et al. (2002) focused on different functionality aspects of IT (e.g., infrastructure and application).  Apart from general IT investment, there were also a few studies specific to IT applications (e.g., ERP, e-business, and security).  Nevertheless, the steps of the event study adopted in previous studies were similar.  All previous studies first analyzed abnormal return based on subsamples followed by subsampling analysis.  Most studies adopted a three-day event window around IT investment announcements.  Both parametric and non- parametric tests (e.g., sign test and Corrado’s rank test) were used to determine the level of significance of abnormal return in the estimation period.  Furthermore, most of the sample data were from the United States.  Meng and Lee (2007) was the only study that compared the reaction of IT investment in the United States with that in China.  A summary of previous research on IT investment using event studies is shown in Table A1.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1—Appendices/March 2019 A3 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures Appendix c Steps to Conduct an Event Study The event study has been widely used in the fields of accounting, finance, and IS to evaluate the short-term market reaction as a result of the occurrence of an event.  It involves six steps:  collection of announcements, filtering of announcements, retrieval of stock data and further filtering, construction of abnormal return model, calculation of abnormal return, and analysis of subsamples (Bose and Leung 2013). In the first step, we collected relevant identity theft countermeasures announcements from an international news database, Factiva.  To retrieve relevant announcements, we used keywords such as anti-identity theft, anti-phishing, phishing countermeasures, personal certificate, one-time password, and dynamic password generator.  Initially, 17,569 announcements were retrieved. In the second step, we filtered repeated announcements and announcements related to non-listed companies.  In addition, we removed announcements that might be affected by confounding news.  We adopted a confounding window of five days (two days before and after the date of announcement), and the list of confounding events included announcements of earnings, declaration of dividends, and change of senior management.   In the third step, we eliminated announcements related to thinly traded stocks.  Previous studies have shown that such stocks were more volatile and might over-react to events being studied and those thinly traded stocks were defined as stocks with an average stock price less than U.S. $1 or average daily trading volume less than 50,000 shares in the estimation period (Subramani and Walden 2001).  After the extensive filtering process, 526 announcements from 1995 to 2016 were retained for subsequent analysis.   In the fourth step, we constructed a model to compute abnormal return.  We considered two models, namely, the CAPM (equation C1) and the FFM (equation C2). R it = + Rα β i i mt + ε it (C1) where Rit was the rate of return for announcement i on day t, Rmt was the rate of return of market index m on day t, αi was the y-intercept, βi was the slope that measured the sensitivity of Rmt, and εit was the error term. The CAPM is a commonly used market model in the event study (Brown and Warner 1985).  However, it has been criticized in prior research for its inability to capture all market risks that led to miscalculation of abnormal market return (Fama and French 1992).  To overcome the inadequacy of the CAPM, we used the Fama-French three-factor model (FFM) for US data and the Fama-French two-factor international model for non-U.S. data as shown in equation (C2).   ( (C2) ) − = − + + − ( ) ) ( 1 γ i SMB t + δ i HML t + α β i i R mit D i ζ i IHML it + ε it R it R ft R ft D i where Rit was the rate of return for announcement i on day t, Rmit was the rate of return of market index m in which firm i belonged to on day t, Di was a dummy variable that took a value 1 when the announcement i was listed in a US stock exchange and 0 otherwise, Rft was the risk-free rate of the return of U.S. treasury bills on day t, SMBt was the size correction factor for day t, HMLt was the book-to-market correction factor for day t, IHMLi,t was the international book-to-market correction factor, αi was the y-intercept, βi was the slope that measured the sensitivity of Rmit – Rft, and γi was the slope that measured the sensitivity of SMBt, δi was the slope that measured the sensitivity of HMLt, ζi was the slope that measured the sensitivity of IHMLi,t, and εit was the error term. We used the stock price data for 200 trading days that ended one month prior to the event date, so as to obtain the coefficient estimates in equations (C1) and (C2) (Sabherwal and Sabherwal 2005).  Prior research only used one market index (e.g., S&P 500).  As our sample data involved global firms, we considered multiple market indices for a particular stock, and selected the market index that resulted in the best R².  The list of 35 market composite indexes used in this research is shown in Table D2 in Appendix D.  As R² indicated the usefulness of a market model, we enhanced the reliability of the research by choosing a model with the highest explained variance  (MacKinlay 1997). In the fifth step, we computed abnormal return (ARi) using equation (C3) for the CAPM and equation (C4) for the FFM as shown below: AR it = R it − ( ˆ Rα β ˆ i i mt + ) (C3)  A4 MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1—Appendices/March 2019 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures AR it = R it − R ft − + ˆ  α β ˆ i   i ( R mit − R ft ) + D i ( γ ˆ i SMB t + ˆ δ i HML t ) + ( 1 − ) ˆ ζ i D i IHML it    (C4) where parameters with a caret were coefficient estimates obtained in earlier regressions. Next, we computed cumulative abnormal return over an event window.  An example using the CAPM is illustrated in Appendix E.  We further conducted a parametric test and two nonparametric tests, namely, sign test and Corrado’s rank test.  The details of the two nonparametric tests are shown in Appendix F. In the final step, we performed subsample analysis and split the full sample into different subsamples.  We compared the CAR between U.S. and non-U.S. subsamples, between early (pre-2009) and late adopters of ITC, and between 2FA and non-2FA subsamples.  Parametric and non- parametric tests were performed to determine the statistical significance.

The cumulative abnormal return for firm i (CAR) was computed using the formula AR it N S 2   = = = 1 St i 1 N CAR (E1) (E2) where N was the total number of firms with distinct announcements, and [S1,S2] was the event window.  ARit was usually transformed to the standardized abnormal return (SARit) using the formula SAR = it where AR ( it AR it Var ) Var ( AR ) it = 2 p i    1     + + 1 D t − mt R − R ( − T ( 2  −= T 1 mt R 2 ) m R ) 2 m (E3) (E4)        pi² was residual return variance obtained from the regression for firm i, D was the number of trading days in the estimation window, and ranged from T1 days to T2 days before the date of the event announcement, and Rm was the average return of market index m over D days.  The cumulative standardized abnormal return (CSAR), which aggregated all SARs in the sample, was computed using the formula CSAR = 1 N N S 2   = 1 i = St 1 SAR it − S 1 2 S   + 1 (E5) Assuming that CSAR followed a normal distribution, we used a one-tailed parametric Z test to test its statistical significance.  The test statistic (Z) was given by the formula = Z CSAR N (E6) MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1—Appendices/March 2019 A9 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures Appendix F Nonparametric Tests Both sign test and Corrado’s rank test were commonly used nonparametric tests in the event study (MacKinlay 1997).  The details of both tests are shown below. Sign Test The test statistic of the sign test was given by the formula = Z t − p t 1( − N Nr rr ) (F1) where pt was the number of positive abnormal returns of stock price for all announcements on day t, N was the number of announcements, and r was the fraction of positive abnormal return of stock price in the estimation period.  Zt followed the standard normal distribution, and determined whether the number of positive abnormal returns on day t was different from the number of positive abnormal returns in the entire estimation period.  Corrado’s Rank Test The abnormal return in the estimation and event windows was transformed using the formula = K it ( rank AR it ) where Kit = 1 corresponded to the smallest ARit.   The test statistic (Ct) was given by the formula 1 N = C t N i ( K  = 1 Var − K ) it ( K ) (F2)  (F3) where N was number of announcements, = K + SD 2 2 − S 1 + 5.0 where D was the number of days used in the estimation window, [S1, S2] was the event window, and Var ( K ) = ( 1 SD + 2 − S 1 ) + SD − 2  = 1 t S 1 1 N    N  = 1 i ( K − it K i ) 2    The test statistic was distributed asymptotically as unit normal.  In comparison to the parametric test, the Corrado’s rank test was better specified and provided higher power. A10 MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1—Appendices/March 2019 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures Appendix G Self-Selection and the Heckman Model Some firms with strong capability in IT might self-select to invest in ITC.  As a result, firm characteristics might influence the market return due to ITC investment.  In the context of outsourcing, self-selection has been observed when firms selected the mode of service delivery (Chang and Gurbaxani 2012) and the type of outsourcing contract (Mani et al. 2013).  To address the potential self-selection bias, we repeated our analysis using the Heckman model (Heckman 1979).  Some prior event studies (e.g., Chen et al. 2009; Li and Prabhala 2007; Mani et al. 2013) have also used the Heckman model to address self-selection bias.   The Heckman model consisted of two stages.  In the first stage, we regressed the probability of investment in ITC on various firm, industry, and country related factors (Zit) using the probit model as shown in equation (G1).1 ( Pr ITC it = ) 1 β ε β β = + Z it 1 + + β Top 3 = it 500 it 0 − − t 5: 1 + ) ( β Attack ln − it 1 2 β β IT Finance i i 5 4 + + ln + ) ( Asset − it 1 + ε β US it i 6 (G1) In the second stage, we regressed the CAR on inverse Mill’s ratio and other factors as shown in equation (G2).2  We computed the inverse Mill’s ratio as shown in equation (G3).3  The self-selection bias is expected to occur if the estimate of the inverse Mill’s ratio is significant. ( CAR ITC it = ) 1 = β βλ β + 2 0 + β IT 4 ( + it + β Finance i 5 ) Asset − it 1 + β US i 6 ln 1 i + β Top 3 + ε it ( φ β Z ) it λ it = ( Φ ) β Z it 500 it − − t 5: 1 (G2) (G3)  In the first stage of the Heckman model, we regressed the probability of ITC investment in each year for all firms in our sample with various firm-related factors as shown in equation (G1).  The frequency of identity theft was defined as the number of identity theft incidents reported in the news media for a particular firm in the year previous to the year when it invested in ITC.  We searched for news4 related to identity theft from Factiva, and counted the number of non-duplicated news articles associated with the company in that year.  The number of security inci- dents was an important factor for senior management to consider for deciding the quantum of security investment.  Security investment decision models have been proposed based on the expected occurrence of security incidents (Gordon et al. 2003).  Firm size, measured by total assets, was a firm factor that could influence intensity of investment in IT (Harris and Katz 1991).  IT capability was used to determine the techno- logical expertise of a company and measured by appearance of the firm on the InformationWeek 500 list 5 (Bharadwaj et al. 1999).  A firm with strong IT capability might self-select to invest in information security so as to maintain its leadership in IT.  Apart from firm capability, we also controlled for the industrial sector to which the firm belonged.  Prior studies on IT investment (e.g., Chatterjee et al. 2002; Dehning et al. 1The notation of equation (G1) was as follows:  ITCit:  Binary variable that denoted whether a firm i adopted ITC in year t; ln(1 + Attackit-1):  Natural logarithm of one plus the number of identity theft attacks on firm i in year t-1; ln(Assetit-1):  Natural logarithm of total assets of firm i in year t-1; Top500it-5:t-1:  Natural logarithm of one plus firm i’s number of appearances on InformationWeek Top 500 between year t-5 and year t-1; ITi:  Binary variable that denoted whether firm i was an IT firm; Financei:  Binary variable that denoted whether firm i was a financial services firm; USi:  Binary variable that denoted whether firm i was listed in the U.S.; εit Disturbance term. 2CAR(ITCit=1):  Cumulative abnormal return of firm i that adopted ITC at time t. 3In equation (G3), φ was the probability density function and Φ was the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. 4We used keywords such as identity theft and phishing in news search on Factiva.  A similar approach has been used in previous research to identify related news on cybercrime (e.g., Bose and Leung 2014). 5In 2013, only the top 250 of Information Week 500 were available.  From 2014 onwards, InformationWeek Elite 100 was used because InformationWeek 500 was no longer available. MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1—Appendices/March 2019 A11 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures 2003; Jarvenpaa and Ives 1991) have suggested that IT might have greater impact on financial services companies and they might self-select to adopt ITC.  In addition, continuous IT investment was necessary for firms in the IT industry to stay in business (Dos Santos et al. 2012).  Thus, IT firms might have a higher propensity to invest in new ITC as well.  Apart from firm and industry factors, we also considered the country factor.  In the past decades, the United States had significantly higher growth in output in information and communication technologies than other developed countries.  Thus, U.S. firms were more likely to invest in ITC and should be controlled.  Table G1 shows the descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients between all variables. In the second stage of the Heckman model, we regressed individual firms’ CAR on the inverse Mill’s ratio and various firm-, industry-, and country-related factors.  The inverse Mill’s ratio was a self-selection correction parameter.  For identification purpose, we removed one factor in the first stage that affected the decision to invest but did not directly influence the market return (Chen et al. 2009).  Therefore, we used the same set of firm, industry, and country factors except Attackit.  Managers might use Attackit as a criterion for ITC investment.  However, its impact on market return might not be direct because investors were likely to evaluate how ITC (rather than number of security incidents) could impact the future performance of the firm. Table G2 shows the results of the Heckman model.  The results in the first stage showed that the impact of frequency of attacks on investment in ITC was positive and significant at the 5% level of significance.  This was in conformance with extant research that suggested security incidents in the past might influence the decision of senior managers about making investment in ITC.  Similarly, size as measured by ln(Assetit-1) and industries related to IT and financial service industries were positive and significant.  However, USit and Top500it-5:t-1 were found to be insignificant. In the second stage, we regressed the CAR obtained in the CAPM and the FFM for different event windows on inverse Mill’s ratio (λit) and other firm-, industry-, and country-related factors.  The maximum variance inflation factors (VIFs) of the CAPM and the FFM were 3.84 and 3.23, respectively.  The low VIFs implied that multicollinearity was not an issue.  The second stage results consistently showed that the estimates of λit were insignificant, suggesting that self-selection was not an issue.  The results were similar to the study on product recall stra- tegies and λit was not significant (Chen et al. 2009).  As a robustness test, we also tried varying firm characteristics in the Heckman model.  Instead of using data from the past four years of the InformationWeek 500 list to compute Top500it-5:t-1, we also used the InformationWeek 500 list from the past one, two, and three years to determine the IT capability of the firm.  Instead of ln(Assetit-1) , we also used the logarithm of market capitalization to measure the size of the company.  Apart from using year as the unit of analysis in the first stage of the Heckman model, we also used month as the unit of analysis and found that the results were qualitatively similar.  The estimates of λit were insignificant in the second stage of the model under all situations.  Therefore, self-selection bias did not affect our analysis. Table G1.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1—Appendices/March 2019 A13 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures Appendix H Steps of the Calendar Portfolio Analysis (CPA) Advantages of the CPA Fama (1998) strongly advocated the use of CPA.  There were various reasons for this.  First, the monthly return in CPA was less susceptible to systematic errors generated by models with imperfect expected return proxies.  Second, using the CPA, the portfolio variance automatically accounted for the cross-correlations of event-firm abnormal return.  Third, the distribution of the estimators of abnormal performance using CPA was better approximated by normal distribution and thus allowed for classical statistical inference.  Loughran and Ritter (2000) found that the CPA approach might detect the lower boundary of long-term abnormal returns because it averaged over months of both “hot” and “cold” months.  The CPA was more conservative than other long-term stock performance analysis methods.  Comparing various long-term stock performance methods, Mitchell and Stafford (2000) empirically found that the CPA was robust to most statistical problems and had more power to identify reliable evidence of abnormal performance of sample firms.  The results provided support to Fama’s (1998) advocacy of the use of the CPA in long-term firm performance analysis.   The main advantage of the CPA was that it did not depend on the cross-sectional variance (Lyon et al. 1999), and the monthly returns were serially uncorrelated (Kothari and Warner 2007).  Therefore, the statistical inference could be more accurate than the conventional event study.  An event study generally assumed stock market efficiency.  When a company made a major decision and made it public, it is assumed that investors would take immediate action and the stock price of the company would fully incorporate such public information.  The assumption might be true for a short period of time.  However, in the long run, when more events occurred, an event study might not be able to account for cross-sectional dependency and overlapped events, leading to incorrect statistical inference (Barber and Lyon 1997; Kothari and Warner 2007).  Therefore, event study was not suitable for long-term analysis of stock performance of a company.  Instead, the CPA could complement the event study by detecting delayed market reaction (Hendricks and Singhal 2001). Steps of the CPA The CPA consisted of two main steps.  First, we constructed a portfolio made up of firms making the announcements.  Second, we measured the long-term return of that portfolio against a market index.  As different countries had different market composite indices, we split the entire sample into various subgroups based on the country of listing of the firm.  A portfolio was formed for each country.   Figure H1 illustrates how we constructed a country-specific 12-month calendar portfolio.  In this example, we assumed that there were only two announcements associated with companies A and B in the same country X.  First, we constructed an investment portfolio P, at the beginning of the month following the day of the announcement.  For a 12-month calendar portfolio, we invested U.S. $1 on the associated stock, and held it for 12 months. To determine the abnormal return as a result of our calendar portfolio, we developed a regression model.  The conventional regression model for the CPA was the CAPM.  For U.S. data, some previous studies used the FFM (Sorescu et al. 2007).  To account for the non-U.S. data, we extended the original CPA for international data analysis.  To the best of our knowledge, this was the first use of the CPA for examining international data. Different from the event study, the CPA did not require filtering confounding events that occurred in the time period of the analysis (Sorescu et al. 2007).  The main reason was that the confounding events were idiosyncratic and the net effect of those events would cancel each other out in the long run (Kothari and Warner 2007; Sorescu et al. 2007).  In fact, the assumption of idiosyncratic confounding events has been empirically validated by Lyon et al. (1999) and Mitchell and Stafford (2000).  It has been found that the abnormal return of a simulated event drawn from a randomly selected sample of firms for CPA was zero one year after the event date (Mitchell and Stafford 2000).  In our CPA, since the duration of analysis was at least a year, it was likely that the assumption was valid. As shown in Figure H1, company A announced ITC adoption before month 1.  We purchased U.S. $1 at the beginning of month 1.  As company B made the announcement of ITC adoption before month 2, we purchased stock B at the beginning of month 2.  Therefore, at the end of month 2, we had U.S. $1 invested in stock A, and U.S. $1 invested in stock B.  At the beginning of month 13, stock A was sold so that by the end of month 13, the portfolio only contained U.S. $1 worth of stock B.  At the end of month 14, the content of the portfolio became null.

Example of the CPA for a 12-Month Portfolio For each month when the portfolio was non-empty, we computed the return of the portfolio, Rpt.  The abnormal return (AR) of the portfolio (αp) calculated using the CAPM and the FFM was as shown in equations (H1) and (H2) respectively.6 − R pt ( R mpt − R ft R pt − R ft = α β p + p R ) p + α β p ( γ p SMB = ft + D p ( R mt − R ft ) + + δ p pt HML pt ε pt ) + ( 1 − ) D p ζ p IHML pt + ε pt (H1) (H2) The situation became more challenging with non-U.S. data.  We constructed separate portfolios for each country and for every month.  If firm C was listed in country Y (different from country X for firms A and B), and made a relevant announcement before month 1, then the investor bought U.S. $1 worth of stock C and held it for 12 months.  In that case, in month 1, the investor invested U.S. $1 in stock A listed in country X, and U.S. $1 in stock C listed in country Y.  Hence, the CPA for month 1 gave rise to two separate equations instead of one.  The equations for computation of CAR for stocks A and C would use different rate of return of market index, Rmpt and international book-to-market correction factor, IHMLpt corresponding to different countries.    As the number of stocks in the portfolio P varied from one month to another, we used a weighted least squares regression method, where the square root of the number of stocks in the portfolio in a particular month was used as the weight (Sorescu et al. 2007).  An example to compute weighted least squares is illustrated in the next subsection. To further analyze the long-term impact of the event over different time periods, we also conducted the CPA for 18 and 24 months as part of a procedure for sensitivity analysis.  Furthermore, subsampling analysis was conducted to determine if the moderating variables were also significant in the long term. An Example to Compute Weighted Least Squares We use the following example to explain how to compute coefficient and test statistics using weighted least squares (WLS).  Assuming that we had n observations and four independent variables (namely, intercept, Rmt – Rft, SMBt and HMLt), the guiding equation would be as shown in (H3): Y = X β ε + (H3) where Y was a vector dependent variable, β was a vector coefficient of X,  X was a vector independent variable, and ε was the disturbance term. 6Note that the time period under consideration here is month rather than day.

To compute WLS, first, we obtained a weight matrix, W, which was the square root of total number of stocks in a portfolio. Then we obtained estimate,  as shown in equation (H4): ˆ = β argmin W Y X β − ( 1 2 2 ) β = ( W WX ′ ) − 1 ′ X WY The variance-covariance matrix of parameter β, Mβ, was computed as follows: β = M ( ′ X WX − 1 ) ′ X WMW X X WX ′ ( ′ − 1 ) (H4) (H5) The variance of parameter βi was  iiM β .  The test statistics was computed as  ˆ β iiM β . A16 MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1—Appendices/March 2019 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures Appendix I Cross-Sectional Regression on Short-Term Abnormal Return In the event study, we analyzed individual hypothesized variables, namely, US, Old, and 2FA, separately in subsampling analysis.  In the subsampling analysis, it was difficult to observe the joint effect of the hypothesized variables on abnormal return.  Therefore, we implemented a cross-sectional regression to analyze the joint effect of hypothesized variables (Dos Santos and Peffers 1995; MacKinlay 1997).  In the regression, we combined all hypothesized variables, namely, US, Old, and 2FA, and other control variables that were known to influence short- term abnormal return.  The dependent variable CSAR measured the standardized short-term market reaction as a result of ITC adoption in the event window [0, 1].  Cross-sectional regression has been commonly used in previous event studies (Andoh-Baidoo and Osei-Bryson 2007; Bose and Leung 2014; Chatterjee et al. 2001).  It served as a robustness check alongside the event study.  The regression is shown in equation (H1).  Following previous studies, quantile regression with Huber-White estimator of variance was used because this regression was known to be robust to outliers and non-normality of disturbance term, and could minimize cross-sectional and cross-correlational heteroscedasticity (Bose and Leung 2014; Koenker and Hallock 2001).  The definition of variables used is shown in Table I1 and the results are shown in Table I2.  Following previous studies, we controlled for size, which was measured by the logarithm value of total assets (Acquisti et al. 2006; Cavusoglu et al. 2004; Kannan et al. 2007), IT capability (i.e., IW500) (Bharadwaj et al. 1999), dummies of industries that were frequent targets of identity theft (i.e., IT and Finance) (Bose and Leung 2014) and time related dummy variable.

It suggested that U.S. country factor and time of adoption were significant factors that contributed to the positive CSAR.  The results were similar to the event study analysis except that 2FA was not significant in the cross-sectional analysis.  The negative and significant coefficient estimate of IT suggested that the market did not reward IT firms that adopted ITC.  Investors might perceive ITC adoption by IT firms as natural (and not surprising) when compared with ITC adoption by non-IT firms.

Tobin’s Q was a forward looking measure that could capture a firm’s future performance potential from a capital market perspective (Bharadwaj et al. 1999).  Tobin’s Q has been used in a number of studies (e.g., Bardhan et al. 2013; Bharadwaj et al. 1999; Brynjolfsson 1996; Melville et al. 2004; Tanriverdi 2005).  We ran a cross-sectional regression to analyze whether the hypothesized variables, namely, US, Old, and 2FA, had an impact on a firm’s long-term market value.  It might be considered as a robustness check for the CPA.  We followed previous literature on Tobin’s Q and defined it as (MVE + PS + DEBT) / TA where MVE was the market value at the end of a year; PS was the liquidating value of a firm’s outstanding preferred stock; DEBT was current liabilities minus current assets plus book value of inventories and long-term debt for a firm (Bharadwaj et al. 1999).  We followed previous literature on IT business value and controlled for corporate assets, firm size (measured by number of employees), IT capability (measured by presence of the firm in the InformationWeek 500 list in the most recent five years), industry Tobin’s Q, a variable that indicated whether a firm had a negative earnings announcement, research and development expenses and year dummy variable (Bardhan et al. 2013; Bharadwaj et al. 1999).  We used U.S. dollars as the unit of currency.  Foreign currency was converted to U.S. dollars  using the exchange rate in the same time period of analysis.  The regression is shown in equation (J1).  Following previous studies, quantile regression with Huber-White estimator of variance is used.   We computed industry Tobin’s Q by collecting data from CompuStat.  Other data were collected from Thomson Reuters.  As some data were not available (CompuStat had data up until the year 2015 at the time of research), six announcements were not included in the analysis.

Old was negative and significant at the 1% level when a contemporary Tobin’s Q was used whereas 2FA was positive and significant at the 10% level when a one-year-lagged Tobin’s Q was used.  The results were similar to the CPA analysis where US was found to be positive and significant.  Also, the AR generated by Old MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1—Appendices/March 2019 A19 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures sample in the CPA was not as high as the Recent sample.  The AR of 2FA sample in the CPA was found to be significant when a longer duration was used.  With regard to the control variables, the results showed that firms with more assets were more diversified and sluggish in the pace of innovation, and thus had a smaller Tobin’s Q (Chen et al. 2005).  Firms that experienced loss also had a lower Tobin’s Q (Bardhan et al. 2013) and firms with higher research and development expenses had a higher Tobin’s Q (Bardhan et al. 2013).   Table J2.

Such benefits might be associated with reduction in operational risks as ITC adoption could alleviate risks of adopting firms due to decrease in security threats.  Such reduced risks could be measured using an accounting approach.  In this appendix, we evaluated whether individual firms experienced reduction in risks after ITC adoption and implemented a firm-specific risk factor analysis.  We measured a firm’s risk by calculating the residual standard deviation of the firm’s monthly market model.  The same approach has been used in prior research for calculating the firm-specific risk prior to a trading partner’s announcement of quarterly earnings (Pandit et al. 2011).  As shown in Figure K1, we measured the firm-specific risk t months (12, 18, and 24 months) before and after the adoption of ITC.  We used equations (K1) and (K2) as the market models and summarized the results in Table K1.

As a robustness check, we also evaluated such changes 18 and 24 months after the adoption.  As shown in Table K1, we did not observe any significant changes in risk in both the CAPM and the FFM 12 months after the adoption of ITC.  The risks were similar at 18 months after the adoption, except that in the CAPM we observed a slight increase in risk.  However, when we compared the risks 24 months before and after ITC adoption, they declined significantly over time as shown in the pairwise sample t-tests.7  Such reduction in market risks might explain why ITC adopters enjoyed positive long-term market return in earlier analysis. Appendix L Calculation of Financial Impact Resulting from Adoption of ITC in an Event Study McWilliams and Siegel (1997) suggested that the financial impact (FI) as a result of an event could be computed as a product of abnormal return, stock price, and number of shares outstanding.  To determine the average FI of all sample firms, we used equation (L1). FI CAR P S × × = CAR where  price of sample firms, and   was the mean cumulative abnormal return of sample firms in an event window as a result of an event study,  S  was average number of shares outstanding of sample firms. (L1) P  was average stock Some might argue that stock price and outstanding shares varied significantly across firms.  Therefore, the product of average stocks price and average shares outstanding might not correctly represent the average market capitalization of all firms.  In view of this, we also computed overall financial impact by multiplying average abnormal return with average market capitalization of adopters as shown in equation (L2). Market capitalization is computed as the product of stock price and number of outstanding shares. FI CAR MC = × (L2) CAR   where  capitalization measured by the product of price of an individual firm and its number of shares outstanding, and  capitalization of sample firms.  was the cumulative abnormal return of sample firms in an event window as a result of an event study,  MC MC  was market  was average market As shown in Table L1, when equation (L1) was used, the adoption of ITC generated a market value gain of U.S. $587 million using the CAPM and U.S. $583 million using the FFM.  Equation (L2) generated slightly higher market value gains of U.S. $604 million and $613 million using the CAPM and the FFM, respectively. 7As some firms were either not yet listed or delisted some months before or after ITC adoption, they were not included in the risk analysis.  Therefore, the sample size of firms in different time periods were different as shown in Table K1.

To investigate whether such a significant effect was due to better IT infrastructure, we performed a subsample analysis based on information and communication technologies (ICT) development of countries of individual sample firms.  The measurement of ICT development was through the Network Readiness Index (NRI) developed by the World Economic Forum.  NRI measured whether a country possessed necessary drivers to realize the potential of digital technologies, and whether such technologies had significant impact on the country’s economy and society.  NRI was derived from 53 indicators from four perspectives, namely, environment (i.e., political, regulatory, business, and innovation environments), readiness (i.e., infrastructure, affordability, and skills), usage (i.e., individual, business, and government usage), and impact (i.e., economic and social impacts) based on the World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey and other sources (e.g.,  United  Nations  Education,  International  Telecommunication  Union,  The  World  Bank,  etc.).    The  World  Economic  Forum (https://www.weforum.org/) have published NRI of over 100 economies in ‘The Global Information Technology Report’ since 2001.8  We collected all reports from 2001 to 2016 and computed the average NRI of countries represented in the sample, as shown in Table M1.  The value of NRI ranged from 1 (lowest) to 7 (highest).  Advanced economies usually showed a value of NRI above 5.  We used 5 as a threshold to indicate a country/region with high NRI or ICT development. We performed subsample analysis and conducted the event study with the event window [0, 1] and the CPA.  The event study results are shown in Table M2 and the CPA results are shown in Table M3.  As shown in Table M2, countries with advanced ICT development showed significant and positive CAR after adoption of ICT in both the CAPM and the FFM.  In contrast, countries with low ICT development showed insignificant CAR in both the CAPM and the FFM.  It should be noted that in the FFM, most Fama-French country factors were from advanced economies.  As a result, in the low NRI (LNRI) subsample, there were fewer firms due to unavailability of Fama-French country factors. As depicted in Table M3, the results of the CPA showed that the HNRI subsample showed positive AR in all time periods, which was higher than that of the LNRI subsample.  In months 18 and 24, the AR of the HNRI subsample was positive and significant whereas that of the LNRI subsample was not significant.  The results were consistent with our U.S. subsample analysis that ITC could bring in long-term return to adopters. 8The most recent report is available from http://reports.weforum.org/global-information-technology-report-2016/.

We examined the annual reports and identified paragraphs associated with online/e-commerce security, compliance, identity theft, and online fraud.  The statements showed that the companies cared about online security.  It might justify their action to adopt ITC to safeguard the identity of customers. The statistics of firms whose annual reports contained security-related statements are shown in Table N1.  Out of 526 sample firms, there were between 67 and 88 firms without annual reports.  Because some annual reports were very old at the time of retrieval, they were not available in any year on company websites.  Also, for some recent announcements, the t+1 annual reports (e.g., for years 2016 and 2017) were not available at the time of research.  So, the number of missing annual reports was higher for t+1.  In addition, some firms’ annual reports were written in foreign languages that could not be analyzed by the authors (e.g., Arabic and Japanese).  They were not included in the analysis.  Nevertheless, we had several interesting findings from the analysis of the annual reports of ITC adopters.   Comparing between U.S. and non-U.S. firms, we found that U.S. firms had more security-related statements in their annual reports than the non-U.S. firms.  The difference in percentage was more than 20%.  The results seemed to corroborate with our earlier arguments that U.S. firms were more conscious about information security than those in other countries.  This might be related to more tightened regulations in the United States with regard to online security and protection of personal information.  Comparing between “Old” and “Recent” groups, we found that over time firms became more aware of information security.  We found that the “Recent” group had higher proportion of firms whose annual reports contained information security related statements than the “Old” group with the difference in percentage greater than 5%.  When we compared the groups for 2FA and non-2FA, there was almost no difference at all.  Table N1 summarizes the above observations in more details.

Statistics of Annual Reports of Firms with Security Related Statements t+1 Group t # of firms with annual reports # of firms without annual reports t-1 is one year before ITC adoption; t is the year of ITC adoption; t+1 is one year after ITC adoption Reasons for ITC Adoption Many firms viewed that identity thefts were a kind of operational risk.  Adoption of ITC could effectively mitigate such kind of risks from an  operational  perspective.    Furthermore,  better  information  security  measures  could  enhance  corporate  reputation  and  brand  image.  Providing customers with a safe online environment was also often viewed as a kind of corporate mission and commitment.  It was also a direct response to customer demand and market needs.  Some also viewed that fraud prevention was a focused/strategic area for future development.  In different countries, related laws had been established to request e-commerce service providers to safeguard online security and customer data and privacy.  Adoption of better security measures was a kind of legal compliance.  It could also help mitigate financial loss due to lawsuits from identity theft victims and loss in confidence about e-commerce security.  Besides, online security measures were viewed as innovative products that could help generate competitive advantages.  We summarize each area and show related excerpts in the following paragraphs. Excerpts from the Annual Reports of ITC Adopters Online Security as an Operational Risk “[There are] many other types of operational risks such as those pertaining to payment systems, computer systems fraud” – National Australia Bank Annual Report 2005. “Our business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including … exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud.” – Expedia 2007. “For selected [operational] risks, we establish specialized support groups, for example, Information Security....These specialized groups develop corporate wide risk management practices, such as an information security program.” – Bank of America 2004.

Security Measures as a Response to Market Needs or External Environment “Recent  advances  in  IT  have  led  to  a  rapid  increase  in  and  diversification  of  information-processing  environments  and objectives....Therefore, strengthening the management system to maintain information security against system threats such as information leakage, unauthorized changes and destruction of information is becoming extremely crucial.  To respond to these circumstances, the Bank formulated an Information Security Policy as a basic policy on safety measures concerning the protection of information assets (information and information systems).” – Kyoto Bank 2005. “There have been instances where millions of computers worldwide were affected by being infected by viruses though the Internet.  Similar incidents could occur on our mobile communication network.  If such viruses enter our network or terminals, our system or mobile phones could fail.  In such an instance, our network’s credibility and our customer’s satisfaction might significantly decrease.” – NTT DoCoMo 2004. “We rely on technology, particularly the Internet, to conduct much of our activity.

Legal Compliance to Protect Online Safety “In light of the Personal Information Protection Act that came into effect in Japan in April 2005 and recent increases in counterfeit credit card-related crimes, there are growing calls for technology solutions to help protect information security.” – Fujitsu 2005. “In 2006, Postbank and ING Bank carried out a project to ensure compliance with a new law concerning client identification.” – ING Annual report 2006. “In  order  to  ensure  full  compliance  with  legislative  and  regulatory  provisions  currently  in  effect  as  regards  disclosure  of transactions with related parties, UniCredit adopted some time ago a procedure for identifying related-party transactions.” – UniCredit Group 2004. “We have increased the resources dedicated to compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA Patriot Act.  These laws are intended to assist authorities in identifying illicit financial transactions, particularly those that might involve funds used for terrorist activities.  The laws require that we do more to document the identity of our customers, that we develop a greater understanding of the sources and uses of customers’ funds, and that we report any suspicious activities or transactions to federal authorities in a timely manner.” – Zions Bancorporation 2006. “Federal and state law and regulation require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information.  State laws regulate use and disclosure of social security numbers and require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers.” – Prudential Financial Inc.  2007. “There  are  also  certain  specific  state  statutes  and  rules  that  regulate  conduct  in  areas  such  as  privacy,  data  security  and telemarketing.” – Times Warner 2004. “In addition, in February 2005, the Bank formulated new Regulations on the Handling of Personal Information and established a Privacy Policy (a statement on protection of personal information), while seeking to further reinforce its systems for adequately protecting personal information in line with the enactment of the Personal Information Protection Act as of April 1, 2005.” – Kyoto Bank 2005. “A number of regulators in the U.S., notably the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have been delving into the topic to identify cyber-security risks inherent in financial institutions and to assess the financial industry’s current practices and overall resilience.  Furthermore, the U.S. Congress has taken a keen interest in cyber-security and the financial industry may see additional legislation in this area as a result.  The EU, for its part, has made the mitigation of cyber-risk a priority in its work program for 2015, which is also likely to be followed by new legislation.” – UBS 2014. A28 MIS Quarterly Vol. 43 No. 1—Appendices/March 2019 Bose & Leung/Adoption of Identity Theft Countermeasures “The United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has an on-going program of investigating the privacy practices of companies and has commenced enforcement actions against many, resulting in multimillion dollar settlements and multi-year agreements governing the settling companies’ privacy practices.  The FTC, CFPB, and several states have expanded their area of concern to include privacy practices related to online and mobile applications.  Many state laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals,  state  officers  and  consumer  reporting  agencies  in  the  event  of  a data  breach  of  computer  databases  or  physical documents that contain certain types of non-public personal information and present a risk for unauthorized use or potential harm.” – Western Union 2015. ITC Adoption to Mitigate Financial Loss “Substantial data breaches could significantly harm our business, damage our reputation, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and/or cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security, which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands.” – Expedia 2006. “If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our customers’ data, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we would incur significant liability.  Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate  preventative  measures.    If  an  actual  or  perceived  breach  of  our  security  occurs,  the  market  perception  of  the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers.” – Salesforce.com 2005. “The profitability of the Company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, and security of client data.” – Charles Schwab Corp., 2005. “If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data, our data or our information technology systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.” – Part City Group, 2015. ITC as Innovative Products “UniCredit Pass:  a real innovation in online security.  The new authentication technology enables UniCredit Banca customers to carry out online banking operations with maximum safety and simplicity.” – Unicredit Group 2005. “The big novelty of the year 2002 was the introduction of chip technology on payment cards, pioneered in Hungary by K&H Bank.  This new technology is a significant step in increasing the security of card payments.” – K&H Bank 2002. ITC to Generate Competitive Advantages “We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:  performance, security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of the service” – Salesforce.com 2006. “IT work is an integral part of all the Bank’s operating areas.  The aim of these efforts is to contribute to higher customer value and increase internal efficiency, which in time will lead to greater value for the customer.  Security aspects have a high priority.” – ForeningsSparbanken, 1998. References Acquisti, A., Friedman, A., and Telang, R.  2006.  “Is There a Cost to Privacy Breaches?
